# Framer

Framer is a project for adding digital mats to paintings. It is currently a work in progress. Paintings are pulled from the [Art Institute of Chicago API](http://api.artic.edu/), which can be searched for a desired artwork. The digital mat uses Konva to provide a digital canvas that can be adjusted and tweaked. The user can then save the image to their computer.
